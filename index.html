			<p>An informed insight of how an individual has influence on others in a circle can help a business create
				 social media campaigns that aid in marketing and advertising. An approach to determine this is summarized here 
				 with explanations of how to use tweepy API in python to exctract data and how to use the data obtained
				  to rank the users. Users are ranked based on their influence.

			<h2>Problem statement</h2>
			<p>
				What determines the level of influence a user has on social media?
				A study is made to make an understanding of the effects of the social media influencers are in Africa 
				to inform a Social media campaign based on the following factors;  
				<ul>
					<li>Popularity (Retweet Influence): measured by the number of Retweets and Likes users get.</
					<li>Reach (Indegree Influence): measured by the size of their audience.</li>
					<li>Relevance (Mentions Influence): measured by the relevancy of their content.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<h3>Data Collection and processing</h3>
			<p>
				In exctraction of the data, I scrapped
				<a href="https://africafreak.com/100-most-influential-twitter-users-in-africa">Africa Influential Tweeter
					Users</a> and
				<a
					href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/african-leaders-respond-to-coronavirus-ontwitter/#east-africa">Africa
					leaders response to Corona virus</a> websites  to obtain the twitter accounts of the most influential twitter users
					 and top African leaders respectively.
					
				<h3>Data Processing</h3>
				<p>
					In ensuring data quality control, empty entries  were droppped to ensure completeness of the data
					and correct inference of the results during analysis
				</p>
				<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
				I did visualization on the clean to data to help get insight of the trend in the data. 
				The main focus was on the three ranking scores of measuring
				influence; popular score, Relevance score and Reach score.
				
				<h4>Popularity score for Africa goverment officials and Africa twitter influencers</h4>

				<h4>Relevance score for Africa goverment officials and Africa twitter influencers</h4>
				<img src="./Govt_Relevance score.png" alt="Relevance score of government officials" width="300" height="300">
				<img src="./Influencer_Relevance Score.png" alt="Relevance score of influencers" width="300" height="300">

				<h4>Findings</h4>
				<p>
					From the analysis, using the above scores, it was shown that the most influential users addressed matters Corona Virus which is under health and well-being, Human rights and politics.

			<h3>Conclusion and Recommendation</h3>
			<p>
				Retweet influence, mentions influence and indegree influence have big a role to play in determining the
			level of influence a user has on the society and its environment. And this is a strength that can be
			tapped into and utilized by businesses to push products and services through campaigns by partnering
			with the most influential users through marketing and advertising. This is dependent on the category of
			the content of the user.
			I would recommend other factors that determine a userâ€™s influence to be factored in determining if one
			is more influential other than the use of the three ranks of measuring influence. For instance, the
			interpersonal relationship of a user with the virtual community can be considered.
